# To Do list

## Outline

A tech test brief I was tasked with on week 8 on the _Nology bootcamp. The user should be able to create manage and complete items on their own to-do list that can be synced accross multiple devices.

## Requirements

* Host the project on firebase with a custom domain
* The project must be created with React
* The user should be able to log in using gmail

### Extension 

* The components should be unit tested

### Next Goals for the App

I have added code for swiping the components on mobile and pc. The next step is to get these integrated into the list components.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
